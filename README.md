# User Information Input and Storage

This Python project prompts the user for their name, age, and hobbies, and stores this information in a JSON file. 

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository or download the `main.py` file.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing `main.py`.
4. Run the command `python main.py`.

## How it Works

When you run `main.py`, the program will prompt you for your name, age, and hobbies. 

For the hobbies, you can enter as many as you like. After each hobby, press enter to input another one. When you're done entering hobbies, type 'done' and press enter.

The program will then store your information in a JSON file named `user_info.json` in the same directory.

## Future Runs

On subsequent runs, the program will first display the information entered during the previous run. If it's the first time you're running the program or if the `user_info.json` file doesn't exist, it will print "No previous user information found."

## Project Level

This project is suitable for both high school and introductory university level courses in programming or computer science. It's a good project for learning and practicing Python basics.
